Run command:

sudo ./init.sh

Your ImageBuilder dictionary must keep in builder/ folder.
And your Custom files must keep in files/

So does like:

builder
├── OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-ramips_mt7620n-for-linux-i686
└── OpenWrt-ImageBuilder-x86_generic-for-linux-i686

and

files
├── files_ar71xx
├── files_ar71xx_bb
├── files_n14u_bb
├── files_rg100a
└── files_x86

And it will Works Well.
